# GreenCoder-EDA
EDA for GreenCoder : AI Powered Code Optimizer Dataset
🌱 GreenCoder – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

GreenCoder is an AI-driven research project focused on analyzing the carbon footprint of software code using static code features and runtime performance metrics.
This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a 1 million row dataset to understand how coding patterns influence energy consumption and carbon emissions.

**📌 Project Objective**

The goal of this EDA is to:

Understand relationships between code structure, resource usage, and carbon emissions

Identify key features that contribute to inefficient (high-emission) code

Prepare clean, validated data for machine learning models that classify code as efficient or inefficient

**📂 Dataset Overview**

File name: greencoder_standard_1M.csv

Rows: 1,000,000

Columns: 12

Memory size: ~91 MB
